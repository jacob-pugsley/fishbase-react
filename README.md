# Simple FishBase (front end)

This is a search engine for <a href="https://fishbase.org">FishBase</a>, a scientific database of fish species. The system was designed to be easier for aquarium owners to search than a research database, with an intuitive and simple interface and useful data. This is a reboot of the original project which uses React instead of Vue.
